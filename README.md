# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance  
Analyzing employee attrition and performance using IBM's fictional dataset to uncover key factors influencing workforce retention and productivity.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset, created by IBM data scientists, contains information about employees, including demographics, job roles, income, and attrition status. It helps answer questions like:  
- How does the distance from home impact attrition by job role?  
- What is the relationship between education level and average monthly income?
